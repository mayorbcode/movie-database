# Movie Database using React

This helps users find their next movie to watch by showing helpful stats

- Users can see the top 10 latest movies on the front page
- Users can scroll down to see all the other movies (100 max at the moment) according to their release date
- Users can click on any movie to go into the movie details where they can see the ratings, description and actors
